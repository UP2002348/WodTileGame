Features:
- Single Player:
In single player you are playing against your best score. Each time you make a word, the points is added to the score board with the word/s being added to the information board. You have two options to do when its your go. You can either submit a word that you placed or if you can't think of any word then you can finish the game by clicking finish. The clear button removes the tiles you placed on the board.

- Multiplayer:
Firstly you have to select the amount of players you want to have in the game. Then similarly to the single player mode you have a board and a rack. The rack changes each time a user makes a move or if they press pass - which passes the turn to the next player. The finish button also passes the turn to the next player if the next player has not pressed finish. If all players finish state is true then the game ends and the person with the highest score wins

- Boards:
When you click on the boards button in the menu the default board is displayed in the middle with arrows on left and right which allows you to switch between boards. After you decided on which board to play on the home looking button will take you to the menu and you can play singleplayer or multiplayer on your chosen board

- Checks if move is valid:
A check is made each time the player submits a word. This function checks if the tiles placed are either horizontal or vertical, if there is a space, and if the tiles are connected with tiles that was already placed on the board. If one of these checks is false then an error message is shown and the player has to make a new word. If a word/s is invalid then an error message is shown and the word/s are displayed on the information board as red and the user must make a new word.

- Calculates the Score:
If a word is valid then the score is calculated with the score on the tiles and the bonus points from the special tiles
